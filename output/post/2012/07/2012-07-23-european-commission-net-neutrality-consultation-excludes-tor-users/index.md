_**Brussels, 23 July 2012 -- The European Commission blocks TOR users' access to its web site. TOR is an internet anonymisation technology and became widely popular for its facilitating role in the Arab spring movement.**_

_"This is ironic, the Commission is conducting a public consultation on net neutrality, and they already censor a part of the internet to access their site"_, finds FFII President Benjamin Henrion. He was troubled by the issue when he tried to access the consultation website from European Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

_"The European Commission is seeking answers to questions on specific aspects of transparency, traffic management and switching in an Open Internet"_, the website says. But TOR users receive a less inviting message: _"Network Error (gateway\_error) Server overloaded. The gateway may be temporarily unavailable, or there could be a network problem."_
