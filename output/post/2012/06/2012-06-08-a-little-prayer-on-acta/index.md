With [Joe getting poetical](https://twitter.com/teirdes/statuses/210715814196805632), the [Commission into myth making](http://edri.org/commission_myths), and a [church available](http://www.poormojo.org/pmjadaily/archives/036646.php), why wouldn't I try to write a little prayer on ACTA?

**A little prayer on ACTA**

What is legal will stay legal

_As long as you disconnect your computer from the Internet_

You do not have to fear ACTA's criminal measures

_As long as you disconnect your computer from the Internet_

ACTA is not a threat to your privacy

_As long as you disconnect your computer from the Internet_

You do not have to fear United States law in Europe

_As long as you disconnect your computer from the Internet_

The ACTA process was transparent enough

_You were never supposed to have an opinion at all_

ACTA is not a threat to your access to medicine

_As long as you do not pick up a terrible disease_

ACTA will not harm small and medium sized enterprises

_As long as they do not try to innovate and compete_

You do not have to fear disconnection

_As long as you disconnect your computer from the Internet_

You do not have to fear monitoring

_As long as you disconnect your computer from the Internet_

ACTA is not a threat to your right to information

_As long as you disconnect your computer from the Internet_

ACTA is not a threat to your freedom of speech

_As long as you disconnect your computer from the Internet_
