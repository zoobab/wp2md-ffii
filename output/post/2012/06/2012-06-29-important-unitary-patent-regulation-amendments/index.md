The Greens in the European Parliament tabled important amendments to the draft unitary patent regulation. They aim to bring the unitary patent under democratic control. See [unitary-patent.eu](http://call.unitary-patent.eu/campaign/go/unitary-patent-vote-plenary-ams?setlang=en) for the details.

They opened a [piphone](https://www.unitary-patent.eu/content/voting-recommendations-plenary-amendments) so you can call Members of Parliament free of charge. Highly recommended.
