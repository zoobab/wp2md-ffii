According to Marietje Schaake, member of the European Parliament's International Trade committee (INTA), there is a rumor that there will be a request for a secret vote on ACTA. [See her tweet](https://twitter.com/MarietjeD66/status/213904565806972928).

Who would have somehing to hide? A small majority of groups are against ACTA. Proponents of ACTA may hope that a secret ballot may dilute group discipline, with a report recommending adoption of ACTA as result.

First the INTA committee secretariat [denied the existence of coordinators' minutes](http://acta.ffii.org/?p=849).

After that the INTA committee kept the [legal service's opinion](http://acta.ffii.org/?p=992) on ACTA [secret](http://acta.ffii.org/?p=897). After the Legal Affairs committee decided to publish it, the [Chairman of the INTA committee made it secret again](http://acta.ffii.org/?p=1137).

Then Commissioner [De Gucht invited himself to the INTA committee](http://acta.ffii.org/?p=1444), to address the committee just before the ACTA vote. The committee changed that to: you can come on Wednesday, not Thursday just before the vote. ([revised agenda, pdf](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2009_2014/documents/inta/dv/pe491258v02-00/pe491258v02-00en.pdf)): 20 June 2012, 18.00 â€“ 18.30, point 13 Exchange of views with Karel De Gucht, Commissioner for Trade, on the Anti- Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA).

The vote will be on Thursday 21 June after 10 am (point 32, there is a long list). And it may be secret.

Secret ballots are possible under [EP Rules of Procedure 196](http://www.euwiki.org/RoP#Rule_196) in combination with [RoP 169](http://www.euwiki.org/RoP#Rule_169). It takes one-fifth of the component Members.

169.2: "Voting may also be by secret ballot if this is requested by at least one-fifth of the component Members of Parliament. Such requests must be made before voting begins.

When a request for a secret ballot is submitted by at least one fifth of the component Members of Parliament before voting begins, Parliament must hold such a vote."

Secret ballots are very unusual, except for appointments. After years of secrecy, a secret committee vote?
