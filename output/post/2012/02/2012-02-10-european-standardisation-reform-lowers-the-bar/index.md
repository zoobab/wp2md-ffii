**Brussels, 10 February 2012 -- The Consumer Committee (IMCO) within the European Parliament is considering an overhaul of the current standardisation system in Europe. The FFII presents a paper on the proposed recognition of ICT specifications from consortia.**

_"They propose minimum rules against trade and antitrust abuses. It's hard to imagine up an awkward specification which would fail the test"_, explains FFII standards analyst André Rebentisch.

The Commission proposal does not limit official recognition to 'open specifications' (royalty-free patent terms) but also makes consortial specifications under so called "fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms" (FRAND) qualify. The Commission preserves the right to further amend the recognition criteria via "delegated acts".

General concern - set out in the FFII paper - is that universal recognition undermines the existing evaluation schemes applied by public administrations and open standards laws in the member states. 'It's recognised by the EU, why evaluate it again?' The FFII recommends to raise the bar and limit the official recognition to "golden standards".
