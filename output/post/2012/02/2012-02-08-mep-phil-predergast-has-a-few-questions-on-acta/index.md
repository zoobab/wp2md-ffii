Members of the European Parliament could submit as many written parliament questions to the Council and the Commission as they like and force these institutions to make official statements. If you have a technical question about specific ACTA provisions or procedural oddities feel free to suggest your [Member of Parliament](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/) to table them. Most MEPs are not as industrious in tabling parliament questions as [Phil Prendergast](http://www.labour.ie/philprendergast/) (S&D, Labour Party Ireland)  recently, and they limit their tabling to the "priority questions"/"oral questions", where they have limitations but the institutions have to answer in a faster pace. In the past most of the numerous questions on ACTA were posed to the Commission, not the Council. However, only the Council is competent to answer the procedural specifics of the strange criminal sanctions parts.

**Question for written answer E-001048/2012 to the Commission** [Rule 117](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getLastRules.do?language=EN&reference=RULE-117) **Phil Prendergast (S&D)**

Subject: Relationship between the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement and the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights

Article 1 of the Anti-Counterfeiting Agreement (ACTA) binds its parties to their obligations under existing agreements, including the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). Could the Commission clarify whether this nullifies TRIPS Agreement safeguards when these apply to voluntary standards set therein, in those cases where a mandatory standard is set by ACTA?

How does the Commission view the relationship between Article 11 of ACTA and Article 47 of TRIPS as regards the mandatory nature of the former and the voluntary nature of the latter, as well as the lack of a proportionality test in the former? Does the Commission regard Article 11 as a TRIPS-plus provision?

Could the Commission further indicate which elements of the acquis communautaire implement Article 11 of ACTA?

Subject: US Congressional Research Service's legal study of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA)

**Question for written answer E-001038/2012 to the Commission** Rule 117 **Phil Prendergast (S&D)**

Subject: Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, in-transit procedures and patents

Is the Commission in a position to guarantee that Member States’ border measures will not apply in-transit procedures to patents, thus circumscribing such procedures to counterfeit trademark goods as defined by ACTA Article 5(d)?

**Question for written answer E-001037/2012 to the Council** Rule 117 **Phil Prendergast (S&D)**

Subject: Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, in-transit procedures and patents

**Question for written answer E-001033/2012 to the Commission** Rule 117 **Phil Prendergast (S&D)**

Subject: Parties to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement

– Is the Commission aware of the reasons why China, Brazil and India were not invited to participate in the negotiations on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA)? Given that they are not parties to ACTA, how is the agreement expected to bring benefits to EU citizens, as these countries are considered to be the main sources of counterfeit products?

– Given the negative views expressed by the aforementioned countries at the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Council proceedings, both on the process and substance of ACTA, does the Commission still hold ACTA as a model regime for third countries in the future, either within or outside the multilateral frameworks provided by the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) and the World Trade Organisation (WTO)?

– Does it agree that the ACTA provisions fall under Articles 3 and 4 of the TRIPS agreement? In this light, what kind of extended protection will EU citizens enjoy, beyond that afforded by the TRIPS agreement, seeing as the latter does not foresee a regional or Free Trade Agreement exception under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade regime?
