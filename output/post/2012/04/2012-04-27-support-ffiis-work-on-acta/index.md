All FFII work on ACTA is volunteer work. But we do need money for our visits to the EU Parliament in Brussels and Strasbourg, especially now during this crucial voting period. Please [consider donating](http://www.ffii.org/Donations).

The vote in the European Parliament can still go either way. As EDRi's Joe McNamee rightly points out, "[if you think we've won, we've lost](http://www.edri.org/edrigram/number10.8/acta-winning-or-losing)".

In November 2010, while there were good draft resolutions available critical of ACTA, the Parliament adopted a conservative resolution welcoming ACTA. And look at what happened in the US: after massive protests stopped SOPA and PIPA, the Congress yesterday adopted CISPA.

For our work on ACTA, see our [Note on the Legal Serviceâ€™s Opinion on ACTA](http://acta.ffii.org/?p=992), our [analysis](http://action.ffii.org/acta/Analysis), and our [blog](http://acta.ffii.org/).
