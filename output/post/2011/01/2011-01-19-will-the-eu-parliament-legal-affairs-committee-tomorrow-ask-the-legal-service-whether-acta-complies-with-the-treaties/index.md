Member of Parliament Jan Philipp Albrecht (Greens) [wants to ask](http://en.act-on-acta.eu/Committee_on_Legal_Affairs_to_take_a_formal_decision_to_ask_the_legal_service_of_the_Parliament_if_ACTA_is_compatible_with_the_Treaties_of_the_European_Union) the "legal service of the Parliament if the final Version of ACTA and its foreseen legislative procedure is in line with the Treaties of the European Union and which legal possibilities there are for the European Parliament to challenge this in front of the European Court of Justice".

It seems Chairman Klaus-Heiner Lehne (EPP) is rather hesitant to do this. The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreementâ€™s criminal measures criminalise ordinary companies and individuals. [The measures seem to violate the Treaties.](http://acta.ffii.org/wordpress/?p=34)

Update: Decision postponed, [awaits interpretation](http://twitter.com/#!/Act_on_Acta/status/27990199040483328) of [RoP XVI.4](http://euwiki.org/RoP#XVI._Committee_on_Legal_Affairs).
