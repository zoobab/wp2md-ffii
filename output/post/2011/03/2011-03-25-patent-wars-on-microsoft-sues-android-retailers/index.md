Berlin, March 25th 2011 -- This week Microsoft sued the retailers Barnes&Noble, Foxconn and Inventec for distributing devices using the Android platform. The Android is a Linux derivate from Google. It is the most recent lawsuit in a battle of dominance on the tablet and smartphone market.

_"What a desperate sales argument to sue retailers which use a competing platform. It's 'Take our platform or get sued'. Patent war is on. I am inspired by products like Openmoko and Android, not libel and lawsuits."_, finds FFII vice president Rene Mages.

_"We predicted years ago that Microsoft would go after Linux challengers with software patents"_, explains FFII president Benjamin Henrion. _"It shows how patents stifle innovation"_.

The FFII has a track record of making contructive proposals for reforming the patent system to eliminate software patent threats for developers.
