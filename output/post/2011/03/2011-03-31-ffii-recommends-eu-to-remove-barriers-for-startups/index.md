**Berlin, March 31st 2011 -- The FFII answered a consultation call from the European Commission General Directorate Internal Market on the enforcement of intellectual property rights.**

For the EU to help startup companies, the FFII advises to reduce market entrance risks for innovative companies. Most SME and startup companies that support FFII operate in digital markets. In digital markets innovators are often confronted with patent minefields.

_"You have to draw a clear distinction between counterfeiting and business conflicts over the scope of intellectual property rights. Exclusive rights often have unclear validity and scope."_, explains FFII vice president Rene Mages. _"Non-exclusive instruments often provide better stimulus for creativity and innovation."_

With its report the FFII aims to find a fair balance between established companies and startups.
