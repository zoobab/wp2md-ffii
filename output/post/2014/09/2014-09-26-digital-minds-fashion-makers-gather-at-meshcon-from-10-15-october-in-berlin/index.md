Berlin, 26 September 2014 - The FFII invites software engineers, creative minds and fashion hackers to the MeshCon 14’ in Berlin. The technology week is organised in cooperation with the TU Berlin, BBW, Wikimedia and the Mozilla Community. The gathering is about local production, design and distribution of textiles in a way that reaps the full benefit of the digital dividend.

More than 23 Speakers from 12 countries will talk about digital makeovers of knitting machines, open-source-pattern making software, their latest web start-ups, the digital design studio and wearables.

FFII president Benjamin Henrion (BE) contributes a talk on the use of cheap wireless chipsets for wearables. Throughout the event the FFII will be available to offer its insights about patent obstacles for digital fashion makers. The Mozilla Community hosts at the event a Hacking Day on FirefoxOS and Fashion-Apps.

“We embrace open technologies and innovation. Digital technology meshes up with textile making. Meet the leading technologists in the field at MeshCon.”, explains André Rebentisch, FFII.
