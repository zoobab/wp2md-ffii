This Saturday 11 October 2014, in [hundreds of European cities](http://www.stop-ttip-ceta-tisa.eu/), civil society organisations, unions and farmers will organise manifestations against EU trade agreements under negotiation.

The manifestations regard the Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) with the US, the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with Canada, and the Trade in Services Agreement (TISA) with many countries.

The [secret negotiations](http://people.ffii.org/~ante/ttip/FFII-Ombudsman-TTIP-consultation.html) create serious risks for [privacy](http://acta.ffii.org/?p=2050), reform of copyright and patent law, labor rights and the environment, and may give [companies excessive power in conflicts with states](http://acta.ffii.org/?p=2118).

See also the [Statement of Concern](http://www.kent.ac.uk/law/isds_treaty_consultation.html) on investor-to-state arbitration by over 110 scholars.
