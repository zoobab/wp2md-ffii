OpenDemocracy [reports about the back and forth](https://www.opendemocracy.net/ournhs/jurgen-maier/battle-royal-in-brussels-backroom-%27trade%27-deals-under-fire) confusion during Commissioner hearings recently:

> At 16:01 they \[Tagesspiegel\] publish an article on their website: Juncker will drop ISDS from TTIP, this is the policy of the incoming Commission.

It becomes more an more likely that the controversial enforcement of TTIP and CETA with ISDS instruments would be resolved.

This would enable the public to focus more on the substance of the envisaged agreements.
