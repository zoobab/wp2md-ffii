This week the EU and US hold a [second round of trade negotiations](http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=985).

The military and economic power of states depend on their key industries. Both the EU and US want to strengthen their industries, they carefully listen to them.

But a corporate agenda is not the same as a strategic interests agenda. For instance, trading away our policy space, [access to medicines](http://www.citizen.org/documents/public-citizen-letter-to-obama-alerting-to-tafta-concerns.pdf), our ability to fight climate change, or [transferring sovereignty to corporations](http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/on-the-dangers-of-bilateral-investment-agreements-by-joseph-e--stiglitz) does not serve the EU's strategic interests.

The EU Commission makes a mistake. It negotiates in secret. This may make negotiations more simple, but as multinationals are much better informed and listened to than civil society and citizens, there is a serious risk the end result will be unbalanced and will harm the EU's strategic interests.

[Openness and citizens' participation](http://acta.ffii.org/?p=1922) would serve the EU's strategic interests and human values. Secrecy weakens the EU.
