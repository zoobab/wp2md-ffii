According to European Parliament sources, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) has already been initialed. That would be amazing: normally the initialling of a trade agreement is a PR moment. Take for instance the EU - Korea free trade agreement: "EU Trade Commissioner Catherine Ashton and Korean Trade Minister Kim Jong-hoon [have today initialled](http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/09/1523&format=HTML&aged=1&language=EN&guiLanguage=en) a free trade agreement (...) Speaking following the initialling in Brussels, Commissioner Ashton said (...)". The initialling of a trade agreement signifies the closing of negotiations with a stable legal text. Negotiators sign with their initials.
