**Berlin, 12th Sept 2010 -- The FFII calls for better access to public data for commercial and non-commercial purposes. A consultation is now open for public contributions. Citizens, companies, and stakeholders can weight in on opening data for re-use.**

_"Governments should give the public free access to public data, since it has already been paid for with our taxes. Especially in the current economic crisis, free access to public data would immediately create opportunities for jobs and innovation, and spur software companies to create new applications"_, explains FFII president Benjamin Henrion.

Responses would feed into a recast of the "European Directive on Public Sector Information Re-Use" (2003/98/EC) under the European Digital Agenda. The European Commission's re-use consultation remains open for contributions until 30 November 2010.
