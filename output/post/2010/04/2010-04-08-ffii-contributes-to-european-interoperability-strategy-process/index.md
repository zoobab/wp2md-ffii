**Brussels, April 8th 2010 - Until this week everyone interested in interoperability within the context of public service delivery has been invited to send suggestions aiming at contributing to the implementation of the European Interoperability Strategy. FFII e.V. contributed a short 5 pages opinion paper to the consultation of the European Commission.**

The European Interoperability Strategy (EIS) is a top level document for the European Interoperability Framework (EIF) which is essential for policies on open standards and specifications.

"Administrations shall overcome discrimination on grounds of technological choices and unleash the full potential of an open approach", explains FFII general secretary André Rebentisch.
