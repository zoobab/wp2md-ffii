FFII calls to demonstrate against Unitary Software Patents, the third attempt to impose software patents in Europe. Software patents are a threat to small- and medium-sized software companies that cannot defend themselves. The UPC (Unified Patent Court) is an international court made outside of the European Union, which would have the last word over the question of software patenting. The Court would favour "patent trolls" which steal our jobs and extort money.

The french version of this page (Version française [ici](http://blog.ffii.org/manifestation-contre-le-brevet-logiciel-unitaire-jeudi-12-decembre-a-bruxelles/)) has slightly more arguments, but most of them are common. We are looking for translators from french to english to recopy them here.
