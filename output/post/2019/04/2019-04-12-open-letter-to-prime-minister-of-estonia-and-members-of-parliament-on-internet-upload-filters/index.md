Dear Prime Minister of Estonia,  
Dear Members of Parliament of Estonia,

I am calling on Estonian politicians to "take back control" over its national  
position over the adoption of controversal Copyright Directive ("internet  
upload filters") that is scheduled to be "formally" adopted on Monday  
by the Romanian Presidency of the Council of the European Union.

Estonia has made the following statement \[1\] yesterday regarding the adoption of the directive:

> "Estonia has always supported the objective of the Directive, namely better access to content online, the functioning of key exceptions in the digital and cross-border environment and the better and balanced functioning of the  
> copyright marketplace.
> 
> However, Estonia considers that the final text of the Directive does not  
> strike a sufficient balance between different interests in all aspects.
> 
> **Furthermore, Estonia has recently had parliamentary elections and our new government and parliament have not been able to give their position on the final compromise text."**

I have personally contacted the permanent representation of Estonia (COREPER) in Brussels, which has confirmed that, despite the newly formed government and parliament, it is not the intention of the Estonian delegation in Council to ask for a removal of the dossier from the A-items list on Monday.

I am therefore calling on your Government and your newly elected Parliament \[2\] to ask for a formal delay, and to assess properly the negative economic consequences of this ill-conceived directive, notably for the burgeoning internet economy.

Best regards,

HENRION Benjamin,  
President of FFII.org  
Belgium
