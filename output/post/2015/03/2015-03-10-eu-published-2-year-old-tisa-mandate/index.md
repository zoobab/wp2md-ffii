Today the EU declassified a [two year old mandate of the member states to the European Commission to negotiate the services agreement TiSA](http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-6891-2013-ADD-1-DCL-1/en/pdf). These mandates are drafted by the European Commission and approved by the member states in the European Council and authorise the European Commission to negotiate with third countries. The declassification shows that data flows are among the negotiated subject matters, a controversial item in a post-Snowden world.

> The agreement shall contain new or enhanced regulatory disciplines as compared to
> 
> GATS based on proposals by the parties. To that end, the negotiations should aim at including inter alia regulatory disciplines concerning transparency, domestic regulation, state-owned enterprises, telecommunication services, computer related services, e-commerce, **cross-border data transfers**, financial services, postal and courier services, international maritime transport services, government procurement for services and subsidies.

The European Commmissioner Mallstr√∂m [claims in the European Commission Press Release](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-4590_en.htm) that the document shows that "that our high standards in public services will be upheld".
