The United States government defends its investor-to-state dispute settlement (ISDS) model. It gives the US unfair procedural advantages.

**Rigged**

The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) is part of the World Bank. It is the most used ISDS forum; investors can choose this forum. The president of the World Bank has always been the candidate of the US. This president

\- is ex officio chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council ([article 5 ICSID](https://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/StaticFiles/basicdoc/partA-chap01.htm#s02)), - nominates the ICSID secretary-general ([article 10 ICSID](https://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/StaticFiles/basicdoc/partA-chap01.htm#s03)), - appoints all three the arbitrators in annulment cases under ICSID rules (the only possible appeal, [article 52.3 ICSID](https://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/StaticFiles/basicdoc/partA-chap04.htm)).

The secretary-general of ICSID plays a role in ISDS cases, both in the ICSID Convention and in the EU commission's proposals for trade agreements. As an example the EU - Singapore trade agreement ([EUSFTA](http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/october/tradoc_152844.pdf)) proposal.

The secretary-general - appoints arbitrator(s) if parties fail to appoint one, or fail to agree on the presiding arbitrator (articles 9.21.2 and 9.32.7 EUSFTA), - may decide a request for consolidation is manifestly unfounded (article 9.32.4 EUSFTA), - appoints the presiding arbitrator in consolidation cases unless parties agree otherwise (article 9.32.6 EUSFTA), - will decide on conflicts of interest (article 9.21.10 EUSFTA).

Executive officials who have a link with the U.S. take and would take important decisions. This gives the U.S. an unfair advantage. The U.S. can push for a very investor friendly system, knowing that they are protected because ISDS is rigged to their advantage. Other countries will suffer more from ISDS than the U.S.

**Article 52.3 ICSID in action**

We can see article 52.3 ICSID in action. In all (presently 80, [press search](https://icsid.worldbank.org/apps/ICSIDWEB/cases/Pages/AdvancedSearch.aspx?appby=102&typ=CD12)) annulment procedures (the only form of appeal possible) the president of the World Bank appointed all three the arbitrators. That is more than 10% of all known ISDS cases. The president of the World Bank has always been the candidate of the US.

**Exerting pressure**

The U.S. could have lost the Loewen ISDS case. However, the U.S. won the Loewen ISDS case on a technicality.

After the Loewen ISDS case one of the tribunal members publicly conceded having met with officials of the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) prior to accepting his appointment. The DoJ [put pressure on him](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2410188).

**Statistical data**

A study finds that claimants from the US were 91% more likely to benefit from an expansive resolution than claimants from all other states combined. ([Van Harten, 2012](http://digitalcommons.osgoode.yorku.ca/ohlj/vol50/iss1/6)) The US never lost an ISDS case.

**TTP leak**

The text of the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) agreement investment chapter leaked. It is [rigged to the advantage of the US](https://blog.ffii.org/tpp-isds-is-rigged-to-advantage-u-s/).

**White House**

United States Senator Elizabeth Warren turned against investor-to-state dispute settlement (ISDS): ["Why create these rigged, pseudo-courts at all?](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/kill-the-dispute-settlement-language-in-the-trans-pacific-partnership/2015/02/25/ec7705a2-bd1e-11e4-b274-e5209a3bc9a9_story.html?hpid=z6)"

Jeff Zients, director of the National Economic Council, posted [a response to Warren](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/02/26/investor-state-dispute-settlement-isds-questions-and-answers) on the White House website. In turn, Simon Lester, trade policy analyst with Cato’s Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, [refuted his arguments](http://www.cato.org/blog/responding-white-house-defense-investor-state-dispute-settlement).

US [senior legal experts](http://www.washingtonpost.com/r/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/04/30/Editorial-Opinion/Graphics/oppose_ISDS_Letter.pdf): "Under ISDS regimes, foreign investors alone are granted legal rights unavailable to others – freed from the rulings and procedures of domestic courts. (...) ISDS weakens the rule of law by removing the procedural protections of the legal system and using a system of adjudication with limited accountability and review. It is antithetical to the fair, public, and effective legal system that all Americans expect and deserve."

The 2015 [European Commission ISDS proposal](https://blog.ffii.org/eu-commission-isds-proposal-a-threat-to-democracy-and-civil-rights/) would partly or mostly remove the US procedural advantages. The US government expressed skepticism about the proposal.
