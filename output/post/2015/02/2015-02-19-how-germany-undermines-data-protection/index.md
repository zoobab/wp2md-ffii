The German delegation to the Council puts the axe against the data protection regulation. The trick is a special new pseudonyme data proposal. This shows a [document from the Germans that was published by Statewatch](http://www.statewatch.org/news/2015/jan/eu-council-dp-reg-pseudonymisation-14705-rev1-14.pdf).

> Under specific circumstances further processing which leads to revealing (re)-identification of the data subject should be allowed if the controller demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds which override the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject (Art.6 (5)). The controller shall consider all the determinants of risk and assess whether a threat to the data subject exists.
