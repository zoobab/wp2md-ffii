Dear Members of the German Greens in the Bundestag,  
Dear Members of the Greens in the European Parliament,

There is a vote this afternoon at 3PM on the ratification by Germany of the UPC.

The software patent directive of 2005 was rejected at the request of  
multinationals, who preferred to push for a trusted patent court instead of modifying the substantive patent law.

The Greens always had a clear position on this issue of software  
patenting at the EU level, and a clear position during the European  
Elections.  
  
We recommended to our numerous supporters to vote for the Greens during the european elections in each of their countries because the Greens were the only party with a clear position on this issue, as other political parties were split.  
  
**IF YOU VOTE FOR THE UPC THIS AFTERNOON IN THE BUNDESTAG, WE WILL MAKE SURE YOUR ELECTORS IN GERMANY AND ELSEWHERE WILL BE INFORMED THAT YOU BETRAYED THEM IN NOT KEEPING YOUR ELECTORAL PROMISES, IN THAT THE TRUST THEY GAVE TO YOU BY VOTING FOR YOUR PARTY IS BROKEN.**  
  
I will personally make sure this betrayal is well documented and in the media.  
  
We had a similar issue during the ratification in Belgium.  
  
Please read carrefully our open letter we sent few days back:

"In July 2005, after several failed attempts to legalise software patents in Europe, the patent establishment changed its strategy. Instead of explicitly seeking to sanction the patentability of software, they are now seeking to create a central European patent court, which would establish and enforce patentability rules in their favor, without any possibility of correction by competing courts or democratically elected legislators."
