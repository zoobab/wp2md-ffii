**Update**: The European Parliament gave [consent to CETA](https://www.transportenvironment.org/press/meps-rubberstamp-bad-deal-people-and-planet). It failed to defend democracy. Now national parliaments will have to decide on CETA. There may also be referendums and court cases. See also [EDRi's press release](https://edri.org/citizens-rights-undermined-flawed-ceta-deal/); [procedure file](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/oeil-mobile/fiche-procedure/2016/0205(NLE)?l=en  ); [INTA report](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=REPORT&reference=A8-2017-0009&language=EN); [roll call vote](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+PV+20170215+RES-RCV+DOC+PDF+V0//EN&language=EN) (point 1, A8-0009/2017).

Wednesday 15 February 2017, the European Parliament will vote on the EU-Canada trade agreement (CETA).

CETA strengthens investments vis-Ã -vis democracy and fundamental rights. [1](#fn-.1) This undermines our values, ability to reform, and ability to respond to crises, including climate change. [2](#fn-.2)

CETA undermines protection of personal data, as it includes data flows under an outdated, insufficient safeguard. [3](#fn-.3)

CETA undermines health [4](#fn-.4) and strengthens the position of patent trolls [5](#fn-.5). See also [Making sense of CETA](https://corporateeurope.org/international-trade/2016/09/new-study-analyses-eu-canada-trade-deal-ceta), a broad analysis. [6](#fn-.6)

Take action! See [La Quadrature du Net](https://www.laquadrature.net/en/lets-dump-ceta-once-for-all), Let's dump CETA once and for all!; [CETA Check](https://cetacheck.stop-ttip.org/en/), and [SumOfUs](https://actions.sumofus.org/a/tell-a-member-of-the-european-parliament-stop-the-dangerous-ceta-trade-deal).

(The CETA text is [arguably worse](https://blog.ffii.org/ceta-who-pulled-the-plug-on-the-right-to-regulate/) than the TTIP proposal.) The CETA option to "upgrade" to a multilateral investment court [isn't helpful](https://blog.ffii.org/multilateral-investment-court-assessment-obscures-social-and-environmental-impacts/).

[3](#fnr-.3) "Going beyond the GATS, the CETA, TTIP and TiSA agreements are very comprehensive and cover cross-border trade in services, which inevitably involves the processing and transferring of personal data in connection with the conduct of a service supplier's business."

The study shows the safeguard, GATS article XIV like, does not provide sufficient certainty (page 34).
