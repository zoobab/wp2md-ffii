Faced with massive critique, the European Commission announced a [consultation on investor-to-state dispute settlement](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-56_en.htm) (ISDS).

ISDS gives multinationals the right to [sue states before special tribunals if changes in law may lead to lower profits than expected](https://www.vrijschrift.org/serendipity/index.php?/archives/154-Investment-tribunals-above-supreme-courts.html). Multinationals can challenge reform of copyright and patent law, challenge environmental and health policies.

The Commission even announced the publication of a proposed EU text. That seems a step forward.

But a diplomatic source told EU Trade Insights that [other trade deals are unlikely to change](http://www.vieuws.eu/eutradeinsights/ttip-investor-state-consultation-no-impact-on-other-trade-deals/). For instance the trade agreement with Canada also contains ISDS.

So the Commission will hold a consultation on ISDS that will attract the attention, and secretly advance ISDS in other agreements...

All ISDS negotiations will have to put on hold.

Let's not forget: ISDS is not acceptable in the agreement with the US, not acceptable in the agreement with Canada, not acceptable in the agreement with Singapore, not acceptable in any agreement.
