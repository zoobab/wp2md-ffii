According to the announcement there will be speakers from Amnesty International, ACCESS, Oxfam, Article19, Health Action International, Reporters Without Borders, Consumer Rights groups, Knowledge Ecology Online, an SME organization, International Federation of Library Associations, Academics and Researchers, High level advisors and the Council of Europe.

Update: it was a very interesting meeting, pointing out very serious issues with access to medicines and fundamental rights. The SME organisation was PIN-SME. Jan Malinowsky of the Council of Europe said: "policy goals should not be to protect outdated business models." Professor Julian Kinderlerer, a member of the European Group on Ethics in Science, was sharp on ACTA. Seemingly referring to the Court's opinion on ACTA, he said that ACTA may be legal, but that does not make it good morally.
