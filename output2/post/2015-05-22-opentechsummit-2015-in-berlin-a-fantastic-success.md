The [OpenTechSummit](http://opentechsummit.net) 2015 took place for the first time in Berlin on May 14, 2015 with the [Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure](http://ffii.org) as a core partner and supporter. With more than 700 attendees - from policy makers, developers, start-ups, to contributors - and over 70 speakers the event was a huge success. A wonderful atmosphere came up through the participation of lots of kids in the hacking area and in the workshops.

The goal of the OpenTechSummit is to offer participants a platform to learn about future technologies and meet leading Open Source experts and policy makers who share their insights, ideas and success stories. The OpenTechSummit is run as a non-profit event in cooperation with the Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure, which is also funding parts of the event. Other partners are the Förderverein Freie Netze e.V. and the Linuxtag e.V. Regular [OpenTech Meetups](http://www.meetup.com/OpenXLab/) take place in Berlin and around the world. The first OpenTechSummit was held in Taiwan 2009. The organization team brings together Monic Meisel (Freifunk), André Rebentisch (FFII e.V.) and [Mario Behling](http://twitter.com/mariobehling) (FashionTec/OpenXlab Berlin).
