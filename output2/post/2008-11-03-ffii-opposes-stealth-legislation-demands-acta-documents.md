**Brussels, 3rd November 2008 - The Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure (FFII) has requested 12 secret Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) documents from the EU Council. Behind closed doors, the EU, US, Japan and other countries are negotiating ACTA. The negotiating parties plan on making the ACTA text public only after the parties have agreed to it.**

Based on leaked information, the FFII is deeply concerned that ACTA may give patent trolls further means to extort companies, lead to monitoring all citizens' Internet communications and criminalize peer-to-peer electronic file sharing.

Parliaments and the public are in the dark about ACTA. Stakeholders, experts and public interest organisations can not scrutinize ACTA documents. Both the European Parliament and the member states of the EU have vetoes on aspects of ACTA. FFII analyst Ante Wessels says: _"Parliaments cannot build an informed opinion about ACTA and therefore will not be well prepared to use their power."_

On its website, the European Commission calls ACTA "path breaking". The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee expressed concerns that ACTA will prescribe rules for protection so specifically that it could impede Congress's ability to make constructive policy changes in the future. In September more than 100 public interest organizations called on officials from the countries negotiating ACTA to publish immediately the draft text of the agreement.

Ante Wessels: _"With the Computer Implemented Inventions directive, we could finally convince people it was actually about software patents. This time the Commission and Council keep all texts secret. We believe there is no room for stealth legislation in the EU."_

The FFII finds support in a recent European Court of Justice judgment. In the Turco case, the Court stressed the importance of access to preparatory legislative texts: _"Openness in that respect contributes to strengthening democracy by allowing citizens to scrutinize all the information which has formed the basis of a legislative act. The possibility for citizens to find out the considerations underpinning legislative action is a precondition for the effective exercise of their democratic rights."_
