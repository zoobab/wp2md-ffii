**Berlin / Paris, April 14th 2011 -- FFII and AFUL ask consumers affected by operating system bundling or businesses involved in bundling to provide their evidence to the European Competition authority.**

_"My choice is Debian GNU/Linux"_, explains FFII Vice president Rene Mages. _"Why have I been compelled to pay and erase Windows 7 at purchase time?"_

The European Commission admits it was aware of the difficulties encountered by consumers who want to purchase a PC with a non-Microsoft operating system or without any operating system at all. But they also say they lack evidence suggesting that this is the result of practices in violation of EU competition rules.

_"We want to crowdsource the collection of evidence"_, says AFUL's President Laurent Séguin. _"If the EU finds anticompetitive agreements that foreclose competition or abuse a dominant position on the relevant market, that would be a magic bullet."_
