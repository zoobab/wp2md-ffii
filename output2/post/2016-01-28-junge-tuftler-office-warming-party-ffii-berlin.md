[Junge Tüftler](http:junge-tueftler.de) is a society that coaches children digital literacy by using a constructionist approach. To extend our work we are happy about the possibility to share the FFII office space so that we will be able to offer more courses and events for kids in future. We wanna celebrate this with you and all our mentors. So please feel free to join our office warming party on thusday,  28.01.2016.
