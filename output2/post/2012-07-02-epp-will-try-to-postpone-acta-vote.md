The European Peoples Party wants to wash its hands in innocence. Yesterday, Monday 2 July, the EPP tweeded:

"EPP Group ‏@EPPGroup

#EPP will ask during tomorrow's debate on #ACTA for a [postponement of the vote until we have ECJ's ruling](https://twitter.com/EPPGroup/status/219837848587747328)."

The EPP is afraid of a political vote. Postponement would be a wrong approach. The Court’s test is a marginal one on fundamental rights. The Parliament’s committees also looked at broader issues, like innovation and access to medicine. The Parliament has to take a political decision.

So before the vote on ACTA there will be a vote on postponement of the vote. But it seems that the vote on postponement can not take place on Tuesday, because of [Rule of Procedure 177](http://www.euwiki.org/RoP#Rule_177) (24 hour rule).

Make sure the ACTA vote continues on Wednesday, [contact your MEP!](http://acta.ffii.org/?p=1533)

Just before this happened, the European Parliament Tabling Service was about to publish the indicative voting list for the vote on ACTA [here](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sed/speakerList.do).

The vote on ACTA is to be a roll call vote on ACTA itself, (not on the INTA report).

A straight vote, in favour or against ACTA, no amendments.

That is, if the vote isn't postponed...

Debate: [Tuesday 15.00](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=AGENDA&reference=20120703&secondRef=SIT&language=EN),
