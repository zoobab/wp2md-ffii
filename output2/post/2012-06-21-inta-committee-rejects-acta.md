The International Trade committee adopted David Martin's draft opinion which proposes to reject ACTA, with 19 to 12 votes.

[Two amendments](http://acta.ffii.org/?p=1432) proposing to give consent to ACTA were withdrawn. [An amendment](http://acta.ffii.org/?p=1432) proposing to postpone the vote on ACTA until after the Court's opinion was rejected with 19 to 12 votes as well.

A huge victory for civil society, Internet freedom, access to medicine and knowledge, and innovative companies. But we are not there yet.

The plenary vote on ACTA will be on the 4th of July. On Independence Day, said David Martin, ACTA's rapporteur.
