[ACTA would be considered by the European Parliament](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/FindByProcnum.do?lang=en&procnum=NLE/2011/0167). Now a simple fact gets openly admitted:

> "IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out."

and further the Commission claims without any evidence:

> "At the same time, ACTA is a balanced agreement, because it fully respects the rights of citizens and the concerns of important stakeholders such as consumers, internet providers and partners in developing countries."

Don't you agree that is contradictory? Either you assess the impact or you don't.

Would the missing Impact Assessment weakness be a honey pot for MEPs, like lack of transparency during the negotiations? We know very well, a missing Impact Assessment makes all MEPs complain. Still the Impact Assessment issue distracts from more rotten provisions under the hood.
