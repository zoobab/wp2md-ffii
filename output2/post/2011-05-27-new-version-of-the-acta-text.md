The EU Commission published a [new version of the ACTA (Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement) text](http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/html/147937.htm) (pdf).

A Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan [announcement mentions an April 15 round of negotiations](http://www.mofa.go.jp/announce/announce/2011/5/0501_01.html): "The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) was opened for signature on May 1, following its adoption by participants in its negotiations on April 15."

Changes in the text

removed: "3 December 2010" (the date the prior "final" text was made.)

changed: "This Agreement shall remain open for signature by participants in its negotiation,17 and by any other WTO Members the participants may agree to by consensus, from 31 March 2011 until 31 March 2013."

To: "This Agreement shall remain open for signature by participants in its negotiation,17 and by any other WTO Members the participants may agree to by consensus, from 1 May 2011 until 1 May 2013."

There do not seem to be any other changes.

[See the euwiki quick and dirty diff](http://euwiki.org/index.php?title=ACTA%2FFinal_ACTA_text&diff=11394&oldid=11393 ).

(Note the EU Commission [website still links](http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/cfm/doclib_results.cfm?key=acta&opt=1&dis=20&lan=all&ty=&sta=1&en=20&page=1&year1=&year2=&sector=all&country=all&langId=en) to the earlier document. It seems the Commission notified the Parliament about the new version, but did not update the website.)

**Update**

The [Commission's website now links to both versions](http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/cfm/doclib_results.cfm?key=acta&opt=1&dis=20&lan=all&ty=&sta=1&en=20&page=1&year1=&year2=&sector=all&country=all&langId=en), they are both labeled 3 December 2010 (which is wrong, one of them is more recent). The Commission sent the earlier version (containing 31 March) [to the Council](http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/11/st12/st12193.en11.pdf).
