Members of the European Parliament want the EU's Court of Justice to check whether a parallel legal system in the trade agreement with Canada (CETA) is compatible with the EU treaties. The parallel legal system, known as ISDS / ICS, is only accessible to foreign investors. [Eighty-nine members](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+MOTION+B8-2016-1220+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN) tabled a [resolution](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+MOTION+B8-2016-1220+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN). The Parliament will vote next week, Wednesday 23 November 2016.

According to associations of judges ([one](http://bilaterals.org/?opinion-on-the-establishment-of-an&lang=en), [two](http://www.iaj-uim.org/iuw/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/EAJ-report-TIPP-Court-october.pdf)), academics ([letter from over 100 law professors](https://stop-ttip.org/blog/legal-statement-on-investment-protection-in-ttip-and-ceta/)) and NGOs ([ClientEarth](http://www.documents.clientearth.org/library/download-info/legal-briefing-ep-legal-service-opinion-on-ics-in-ceta/), [two pager](http://foeeurope.org/legal-briefing-isds-eu-law-141215)), the ISDS / ICS parallel legal system is not compatible with the EU treaties.

**Debate suppression: Put on the blinkers**

The Parliament's trade committee wants to ratify CETA as soon as possible, without the legal check proposed in the resolution. The [Conference of Presidents](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/organs/confpres/default_en.htm) decided to [not allow a debate](http://www.globaljustice.org.uk/news/2016/nov/18/meps-attempt-block-legal-scrutiny-new-corporate-court-system-eu-canada-trade-deal) on the resolution. This does not look good. The EU risks ratifying a trade agreement that is not legal and would [undermine democracy and the rule of law](https://blog.ffii.org/mep-schaake-unconvincingly-defends-isds-in-ceta/). If your MEP does not [support the resolution](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+MOTION+B8-2016-1220+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN) and seems undecided on CETA (see the [CETA check](https://stop-ttip.org/cetacheck/)), you may like to [contact your MEP](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/map.html). Our core values are at stake.

**Ratification vote**

The major vote on CETA, the ratification vote, may be as soon as 14 December (see [Forcasts](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/oeil-mobile/fiche-procedure/2016/0205(NLE)?lang=en)). The Conference of Presidents decided that the employment and environment committees are [not allowed](https://mobile.twitter.com/BartStaes/status/799309819589103616) to issue their (critical) opinions. Despite many concerns, the Parliament rushes through ratification. [1](#fn-.1) The foreign affairs committee (which is in favour) [is allowed](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/oeil-mobile/fiche-procedure/2016/0205(NLE)?lang=en) to issue its opinion.

The Parliament's leadership is manufacturing consent.

**Update:** On Monday 21 November the Parliament voted on whether to have a debate on referring the question to the Court. The Parliament rejected the debate [184 to 170, 9 abstentions](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+PV+20161121+RES-RCV+DOC+PDF+V0//EN&language=EN). So, Wednesday a vote on the resolution to ask the Court's opinion, without first a debate.

**Update 2**: The Parliament [voted against the resolution](http://transenv.eu/2gjNtWf) to refer ISDS/ICS to the Court. Who voted in favour and against? See the [roll call vote](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+PV+20161123+RES-RCV+DOC+PDF+V0//FR&language=EN) on resolution [B8-1220/2016](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+MOTION+B8-2016-1220+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN).

MEPs protested against the time table for the ratification vote; this may lead to more time and debate.
