**Update**: final text is out, [just as rigged.](https://blog.ffii.org/tpp-rigged-isds/)

\------------------------------------

Wikileaks has released the "[Investment Chapter](https://wikileaks.org/tpp-investment/WikiLeaks-TPP-Investment-Chapter.pdf)" from the secret negotiations of the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) agreement. It contains the highly controversial investor-to-state dispute settlement mechanism (ISDS), which makes it possible for multinational to sue states for international tribunals.

For a first analysis see [Public Citizen](http://citizen.org/documents/tpp-investment-leak-2015-release.pdf).

I will point out one aspect of the TPP ISDS section: it is rigged to the advantage of the U.S.

**Rigged**

The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) is the most used ISDS forum. Investors can choose this forum: article II.18.3 (a) and (b) [TPP ISDS text](https://wikileaks.org/tpp-investment/WikiLeaks-TPP-Investment-Chapter.pdf).

In practice the U.S. appoints the president of the World Bank. This president

\- is ex officio chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council ([article 5 ICSID](https://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/StaticFiles/basicdoc/partA-chap01.htm#s02)), - nominates the ICSID secretary-general ([article 10 ICSID](https://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/StaticFiles/basicdoc/partA-chap01.htm#s03)), - appoints all three the arbitrators in annulment cases under ICSID rules (the only possible appeal, [article 52.3 ICSID](https://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/StaticFiles/basicdoc/partA-chap04.htm)).

The TPP text mentions the possibility to request annulment in article II.28.8.a (i).

Already in 72 cases the president of the World Bank appointed all three the arbitrators. ([press search](https://icsid.worldbank.org/apps/ICSIDWEB/cases/Pages/AdvancedSearch.aspx?appby=102&typ=CD12)) That is more than 10% of all known ISDS cases.

The secretary-general of ICSID

\- appoints arbitrator(s) if parties fail to appoint one (TPP articles II.21.2, II.21.3, II.27.5), - decides whether request for consolidation is manifestly unfounded (TPP article II.27.3), - appoints the presiding arbitrator in consolidation (TPP article II.27.4).

Executive officials who have a link with the U.S. take and would take important decisions. This gives the U.S. an unfair advantage. And that is not all.

**Exerting pressure**

The U.S. could have lost the Loewen ISDS case. However, the U.S. won the Loewen ISDS case on a technicality.

After the Loewen ISDS case one of the tribunal members publicly conceded having met with officials of the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) prior to accepting his appointment. The DoJ [put pressure on him](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2410188).

The U.S. never lost an ISDS case.
