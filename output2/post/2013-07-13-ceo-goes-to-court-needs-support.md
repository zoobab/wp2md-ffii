[Corporate Europe Observatory (CEO) writes](http://corporateeurope.org/pressreleases/2013/appeal-filed-over-business-lobbies-privileged-access-eu-india-trade-talks):

> "Appeal filed over business lobbies' privileged access in EU-India trade talks

> Lobby watchdog Corporate Europe Observatory today appealed to the European Court of Justice a ruling from the EUâ€™s General Court over information related to the EU-India free trade talks, which the European Commission shared with corporate lobby groups but later withheld from the public."

The FFII criticised the earlier ruling in its comment on the EU - US trade agreement, "[Openness and the right to participate](http://acta.ffii.org/?p=1922)". It is great to see CEO appeals the ruling.

Corporate Europe Observatory has [launched a donation call to cover the legal costs of the appeal](http://corporateeurope.org/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&id=4).

Openness is essential. You may like to support CEO.
