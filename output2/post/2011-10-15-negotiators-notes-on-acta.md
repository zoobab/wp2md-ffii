> Dear Mr Wessels,
> 
> I refer to your request of 1 August, 2011 in which, you ask to receive the Commission's Negotiator's Notes on ACTA.
> 
> As regards the so-called "negotiators' notes", let me first clarify their nature. "Negotiators' Notes" have been added in the evolving versions of the draft negotiating text (the "consolidated" text) as footnotes. These "Negotiators' Notes" varied considerably in content: some were mere reminders for a verification of the coherence of language at the final "legal scrub" or for the applicability of a certain definition already used somewhere else in the text, while others were added to reflect the interpretation that one or more Parties had of a certain concept. They also changed from one round of negotiations to the next, as issues were clarified or Parties made alternative proposals or accepted new compromises.
> 
> In the text agreed at the end of the final round, 10 such "Negotiators' Notes" remained. Five of them referred to clerical issues that were addressed subsequently when the text was "legally scrubbed" to become the definitive version. Regarding the other five, all referring to Article 2.18 of the ACTA text released on 6 October 2010, (which became Article 27 ACTA in the definitive text) there was no consensus among the Parties to adopt them as footnotes to the Agreement, therefore they are not part of the ACTA. Consequently, the "Negotiators' Notes" that remain, may have mere interpretative value to help understand the negotiators' views about certain parts of the Article in question.
