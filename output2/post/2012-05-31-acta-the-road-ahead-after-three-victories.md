Picture above: For the first time ever, those who oppose draconian IP enforcement won a vote in the EP Legal Affairs committee

Today, three European Parliament committees voted against ACTA. Both in the Industry and Legal Affairs committee the votes were very close.

For the first time ever, those who oppose draconian IP enforcement won a vote in the EP Legal Affairs committee.

The EPP tried procedural tricks to still win the civil liberties vote. The vote in the civil liberties committee was a clear win for opponents of ACTA, 36 to 1, but there were 21 abstentions. Proponents of ACTA who didn't want to be on the losing side. The actual victory was smaller than it seemed.

Next week the Development committee will vote, 4 June 2012, 17.30. ([draft agenda](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2009_2014/organes/deve/deve_20120604_1500.htm)) It may be a close vote like in Legal Affairs. The [draft report is very bad](http://acta.ffii.org/?p=1313). Members tabled amendments to change the conclusion.

On June 19 the Committee on Petitions (PETI) will hold a hearing with the petitioners of the ACTA petitions

On 20 (or 21) June the International Trade committee will vote on the final report. In the week of July 3, the Parliament may have its plenary vote.
