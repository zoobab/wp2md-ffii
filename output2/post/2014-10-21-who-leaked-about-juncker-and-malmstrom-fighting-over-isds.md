Last week the Dutch newspaper NRC revealed [a fight between Juncker and Malmström](http://stop-ttip.org/blog/2014/10/17/juncker-to-take-isds-out-of-ttip/) over ISDS. The article ([paywall](http://www.nrc.nl/handelsblad/van/2014/oktober/15/ruzie-over-oplossen-van-ruzies-1428913)) sketched the context: uninformed activists gaining influence. The article suggested Juncker without good reason giving in.

As Juncker does not gain anything with this leak about the fight, I assume proponents of ISDS leaked, and had the ear of the reporter, so they could sketch the context. The newspaper did not give civil society a rebuttal: very bad journalism, endangering our democracy.

[Vrijschrift reaction](https://www.vrijschrift.org/serendipity/index.php?/archives/167-Geen-wederhoor-bij-artikel-NRC-over-ISDS.html), in Dutch, the NRC did not want to publish.
