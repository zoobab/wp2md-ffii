The European Parliament's Legal Services' opinion on ACTA is ready. And it is secret! Not only that, according to rumors in Parliament, it is positive about ACTA. So we have prominent academics and fundamental rights experts pointing out problems with ACTA, and then in a secret opinion the Parliament's Legal Services says it is fine. This is very strange, since the earlier opinions were excellent.

So we do not have access to a secret opinion which will be used by proponents to say everything is fine. The opinion may be very influential in Parliament. This can not be taken seriously. A secret opinion on a public text which has been analysed in public by some of the brightest minds in Europe.

The secrecy seems in violation of the ECJ Turco case. The FFII filed a request for documents.
