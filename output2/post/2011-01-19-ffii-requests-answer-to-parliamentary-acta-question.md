We blogged earlier that ACTA Parliamentary question E-8847 from MEP Marietje Schaake is [still not answered](http://acta.ffii.org/wordpress/?p=342), even though the Commission refers to it. The FFII yesterday filed a request for documents. If the answer exists, we should have it soon now:

Detailed response to Question E‑8847/10

In its answer to Parliamentary Question E-8295/2010, the Commission writes: "As the Commission has explained in its detailed response to Question E‑8847/10(1)" \[1\] But the European Parliament website does not contain a link to the answer. \[2\] I would like to receive the detailed response to Question E‑8847/10. \[1\] http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2010-8295&language=EN \[2\] http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=WQ&reference=E-2010-8847&language=EN
